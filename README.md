# Nuxt 3 with Nord without SSR

POC for [Nuxt 3 stable](https://nuxt.com/) together with Nord using client-side rendering (CSR).

It still uses the Nuxt 3 server for API routes which makes a [BFF](https://blog.bitsrc.io/bff-pattern-backend-for-frontend-an-introduction-e4fa965128bf) possible.

Later on we might want to use [hybrid rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) to start using SSR on some specific routes that might benefit from it (when our Web Components support SSR).

Integrated [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) through a plugin since the Nuxt 3 module is still under development.
Linked it with `useHead()` to set the correct `lang` and `dir` attributes on the `<html>` element.

## Demo

- [Running on Render.com](https://nuxt3stable-with-nord-without-ssr.onrender.com/) (Node.js server)
  - Expect a response delay of up to 30 seconds for the first request that comes in after a period of inactivity because Iâ€™m on the free plan.
- The dashboard and settings navigation items are interactive.
- The settings page input values are retrieved through a Nuxt API route, everything else is static.
- When selecting "Hebrew" as the language the UI is displayed in a right-to-left direction.
- The "Workspace" card heading & language switcher label change depending on the selected language.
